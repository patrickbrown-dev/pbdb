## Description

`pbdb` is a key/value database inspired by chapter 3 of Designing Data-Intensive
Applications by Martin Kleppmann.

> The underlying storage format is very simple: a text file where each line
> contains a key-value pair, separated by a comma (roughly like a CSV file,
> ignoring escaping issues). Every call to db_set appends to the end of the
> file, so if you update a key several times, the old versions of the value are
> not overwritten â€” you need to look at the last occurrence of a key in a file
> to find the latest value [...] (Kleppmann 2017)

It also uses a hash index (like Kleppmann later suggests) to speed up reads.

## Installation

**Option A:** Build and run the provided `Dockerfile`

```
docker build -t pbdb:latest .
docker run -p 1728:1728/tcp pbdb:latest
```

**Option B:** Compile and run the source code

```
go build
./pbdb run -d dbfile
```

## Usage

`pbdb` is an experiment and not meant for production by any sense of the word.
However, if you wish to run it here's how:

```
pbdb run --data DATABASE_FILE --port PORT
```

This will start the database and bind it to `PORT` (default: `1728`). The
database will survive restarts, but will need a moment to reindex its in-memory
hash index. You can interact with the database using http.

```
$ curl localhost:1728/set/foo -d bar
$ curl localhost:1728/get/foo
bar$
```

## Caveats

- You'll have a bad time if your values have new line characters.
- There's no authentication. You have been warned.
